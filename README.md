# SED-Analysis
## Radio Broadband SED Models 
## Project Overview
This project performs a broadband analysis of radio spectra for a sample of 33 calibrator sources observed by MeerKAT. The work involves fitting a combination of MeerKAT and archival survey data (80MHz - 4.8GHz) with a polynomial model created using the Specfit package (that uses Bayesian methods - MCMC) to characterize the sample. 

## Key Features
* **SED Modeling:** Implementation of polynomial models and confidence intervals to fit observed data points for each class (Peak, Upturn, and Linear 'power law' sources).
* **Visualization:** Clear plotting of SEDs with confidence intervals and error bars.
